      <h2>The Capabilities Of The Crane Manipulator</h2>
      <p>The crane manipulator saves you money on paying for equipment (one car instead of two), reduces the total time of loading and transporting cargo, and also allows you to carry out loading and unloading operations in a limited space. The service of renting a crane manipulator is very popular in Odessa, it allows you to load, transport and unload a variety of goods. All planned works at the facility will be carried out efficiently and in the shortest possible time. The manipulator cranes offered by us are installed on the basis of imported, modern cars, have different body length and load capacity.</p>
      <dl>
        <dd>- The crane manipulator has maneuverability that allows you to work in places inaccessible to other types of special equipment.</dd>
        <dd>- Allows you to accurately adjust the boom departure when working in a confined space.</dd>
        <dd>- Allows lifting and lowering loads through obstacles (walls, fences, other obstacles)</dd>
        <dd>- Allows you to work with cargo located below ground level (in a pit, well)</dd>
